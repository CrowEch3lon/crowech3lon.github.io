        <h2>About the Show</h2>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Medical Drama, Mystery, Sarcasm</p>

        <p><strong>Seasons:</strong> 8</p>

          “House M.D.” follows Dr. Gregory House, a brilliant, pill-popping misanthrope
          who solves baffling medical cases in between barbs at his coworkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everybody lies—especially patients. But House’s uncanny diagnostic skills and
          total disregard for social norms often lead to the right solution… eventually.
