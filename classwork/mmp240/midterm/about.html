        <h2>About the Show</h2>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Medical Drama, Mystery, Sarcasm</p>
        <p><strong>Years Aired:</strong> 2004 – 2012</p>
        <p><strong>Seasons:</strong> 8</p>
        <p>
          House M.D. is a televised case study in weaponized intellect and suppressed emotional vulnerability. Imagine Sherlock Holmes with a pharmacy addiction, Hannibal Lecter without the fine dining, and the simmering tension of a failed marriage—but it’s two men who’ve never kissed and never will (but absolutely should).
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a procedural wrapped in existential dread, flavored with unexplained homoerotic tension, and delivered by a man who treats empathy like a communicable disease.
        </p>

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p>Hugh Laurie’s American accent was so convincing, producers thought he was just an exceptionally miserable New Jersey native. He only outed himself as British after they signed the contract.</p>

      <div class="info-card">
        <h3>Medical Accuracy</h3>
        <p>The show hired real doctors to consult on rare diseases — and then ignored timelines, HIPAA, and ethics like they were House’s coworkers.</p>

        <h3>Ratings & Awards</h3>
        <p>House M.D. was one of the highest-rated shows worldwide. Turns out, people love a limping misanthrope who solves mysteries and destroys lives before breakfast.</p>
