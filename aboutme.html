                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hey, I'm Daniel. I grew up in Queens, New York, and now I'm living in Brooklyn. Ever since I was a kid, I've been the kind of person who loves taking things apart just to see how they work. That curiosity led me to tech and design, and now it's turned into a passion for creating cool user experiences and web designs that people actually enjoy using.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm studying Media Arts and Technology at Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC), focusing on UX and web design. After BMCC, I'm planning to dive into Data Visualization through the CUNY BA program, thanks to some awesome mentors I met in the Esports and Game Design (EGD) Collective. I want to work on making Human-Computer Interaction better, especially in the world of augmented and mixed reality. My goal is to design interfaces that are not just useful but also meaningful, blending technology and art in ways that are accessible to everyone.</p>
                <p>I've had some pretty interesting roles along the way, like being a 3D modeler at an indie game studio and managing projects for the EGD Collective. These experiences have taught me how important it is to work well with others, adapt to new challenges, and really understand the people you're designing for. I also spent some time at Hunter College in the Thomas Hunter Honors Program, but I realized it wasn't the right fit for me, so I decided to take charge of my own path at BMCC, and itâ€™s been the right move.</p>
                <p>Outside of school and work, I'm into a bunch of different things that keep me inspired. I love 3D modeling, gaming (Overwatch 2 is my go-to), and reading novels that dive into complex characters and worlds. Some of my favorites are <em>The Meursault Investigation</em> by Kamel Daoud, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> by Oscar Wilde, and <em>1984</em> by George Orwell.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I want to make tech more human. I love finding ways to make our interactions with technology feel more natural and enjoyable. I'm always excited to learn more, work with creative people, and find new ways to make a difference.</p>
